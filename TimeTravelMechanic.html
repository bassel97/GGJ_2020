                    The challenge was saving the data about each individual in the population for any amount of time.
                    The traditional way of saving “Position”, “Rotation” and “Animation state” for each frame or even
                    for every couple of frames
                    doesn’t seem to be efficient.
                    <br>
                    <B>SO HOW TO GET AROUND THIS?</B>
                    <br>
                    The approach I took in the jam was to create a system similar to a state machine
                    where each individual in the population only keeps a list of the actions that he should take .
                    The list is randomly generated at the start of the level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The individual’s start position and rotation is generated once at the start of the level and then
                    saved.
                    <br>
                    Combining the individual’s initial position and rotation with the list of actions generated should
                    guarantee
                    to repeat the same behaviour every time <i>“TimeManager.instance.ResetManager();”</i> is called.
                    <br>
                    The attacker’s logic is just the same as any of the individuals with the exception of an attack
                    action put
                    randomly in the list. On attacking an individual, the actions’ list index stops from incrementing
                    and the individual is put in the death state.
